## User types

For the purposes of this course, there are three types of users:

**`root`** _aka_ **`super user`** • This is the user account that has unrestricted access to every file and directory.
>When you hear of a system getting 'hacked' it means that an attacker got in, and then gained root access.

**`regular user`** • This is a user that can log in, store files in their own home directoy, and play around.
>These are kind of like log-in accounts, without any kind of administrative privilege. Give these to users that you think may screw something up.
