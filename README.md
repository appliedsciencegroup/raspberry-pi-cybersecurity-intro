### Building Your First Application
4. https://github.com/appliedsciencegroup/qerpi
We're going to build QERPI, a small raspberry pi with an LCD that generates a temporary guest wifi network, with a new password every day. Your friends and coworkers can simply scan the QR code and you'll be connected to wifi for the day.

### Building an Alexa Skill
5. https://github.com/appliedsciencegroup/qerpi-alexa-skill
Here we're going to build an Amazon Alexa skill, so you can ask your alexa for the wifi password and it shows you a QR code.

6. https://github.com/appliedsciencegroup/qerpi-speed-testing
Since we are plugging the Raspberry Pi directly into your router, and there are limitations on the ethernet link speed -- here we do some quick testing and debugging
